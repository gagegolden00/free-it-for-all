Materials or misc charges?

I see in the old system these as misc charges and the descriptions are not really materials they
Also how is this being kept as part of the service report? We dont have a way to save this just yet. Interesting database question.
Are these statically made in a helper and then listed in the view?

Should we expand on the materials table? will there be part numbers?

Where do we calculate tax?

Status changes
job numbers
reports numbers
po numbers
